# Lightweight Search Graph

A decentralized graph-based search protocol utilizing Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Lightweight Search Graph is a decentralized protocol that enables efficient, secure, and transparent graph-based search and information retrieval. The project provides a flexible infrastructure for building decentralized search capabilities with robust access control and resolution mechanisms.

## Core Features

- Decentralized graph indexing and traversal
- Secure access control for graph data
- Flexible graph resolution mechanisms
- Efficient data retrieval and querying
- Transparent and permissionless information discovery

## Smart Contract Architecture

The protocol consists of three main smart contracts:

### graph-index
Manages the fundamental graph indexing functionality:
- Creating and storing graph nodes and edges
- Managing graph metadata
- Handling indexing and basic graph operations

### graph-resolver
Enables advanced graph traversal and resolution features:
- Complex graph query processing
- Path finding and graph traversal algorithms
- Resolution strategies for graph data retrieval
- Performance optimization mechanisms

### graph-access-control
Provides security and access management:
- Fine-grained access control for graph data
- Permission management for graph mutations
- User and role-based access policies
- Audit and logging capabilities

## Key Functions

### Content Creation & Management
```clarity
;; Create new audio diary entry
(create-entry 
    (title (string-utf8 100))
    (description (string-utf8 500))
    (audio-url (string-utf8 256))
    (latitude int)
    (longitude int)
    (is-public bool))

;; Update existing entry
(update-entry
    (entry-id uint)
    (title (string-utf8 100))
    (description (string-utf8 500))
    (audio-url (string-utf8 256))
    (latitude int)
    (longitude int)
    (is-public bool))
```

### Monetization
```clarity
;; Purchase one-time access to content
(purchase-content (content-id uint))

;; Subscribe to creator content
(subscribe-to-content (content-id uint) (auto-renew bool))
```

### Social Features
```clarity
;; Follow a creator
(follow-creator (creator principal))

;; Rate content
(rate-content (content-id uint) (rating uint))

;; Create playlist
(create-playlist 
    (name (string-utf8 100))
    (description (optional (string-utf8 500)))
    (public bool))
```

## Getting Started

To interact with the SoundTrek platform:

1. Deploy the smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Initialize user profile using `create-or-update-profile`
3. Begin creating audio content with `create-entry`
4. Set up monetization options via the marketplace contract
5. Engage with the community through the social features

## Security Considerations

- Access control is enforced at the contract level for private content
- Monetary transactions include checks for sufficient funds and valid pricing
- Geographic coordinates are validated before storage
- Platform fees are managed through secure admin functions
- All data mutations require appropriate authorization

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced geographic search capabilities
- Content curation and featured playlists
- Enhanced monetization models
- Community governance features
- Integration with external audio platforms
